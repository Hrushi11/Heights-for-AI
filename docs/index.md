## Heights for AI

Hello and welcome to this website, I am glad you reached here. I am a Machine learning enthusiast and currently deep diving into some of the conceptual topics of Deep Learning. I believe in project based learning so, you would find that most of my blogs revolving around some project or a real world example to understand the topic in more depth.

I have started a series of blogs on Neural networks and currently I am focussing on it. In this series I will try to make understand the beginners about importance of Neural networks and make them understand the conceptual aspects of the same.

This website consists of core understanding of some of the most widely used topics in the the field of deep learning.

## Deep Learning with Neural Networks

Deep Learning is learning the deep, in-depth patterns and important features of a dataset. Dataset here means the collection of different kinds of data that we want to study and, predict a result from. The history of Deep Learning can be traced back to 1943 when Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch created a computer model based on the neural networks of the human brain.

## Multi-Class CNN

For this next project in the series we will be dealing with a "multi-class" problem, where the classes to classify are more than 2 and in our case the data set we choose is the Fruits 262 available on Kaggle. Instead of this you can even choose a better arranged data, the Fruits 360 - A dataset with 90380 images of 131 fruits and vegetables.

This data set consists of 262 different types of fruits. This blog is more focused on the code, and covers only the explanation of the important code.

## Programming neural networks with tensorflow

Tensorflow is a deeplearning framework used to train deeplearning models easily which is opensource and maintained by google.

This notebook deals with training an end to end neural network. We can train a neural network just by using the numpy library but that's a long and tedious process so for to make this easier we will use tensorflow with the latest version.

For this notebook we will build a simple hand sign classifier with the help of a 3 layered neural network.

## Regression model with Tensorflow :

In this blog we will train a simple regression model on our own created dataset with tensorflow and try to understand all the concepts in depth.

Regression model : Regression analysis is a form of predictive modelling technique which investigates the relationship between a dependent (target) and independent variable (s) (predictor). This technique is used for forecasting, time series modelling and finding the causal effect relationship between the variables.

## Water Quality

Access to safe drinking-water is essential to health, a basic human right and a component of effective policy for health protection. This is important as a health and development issue at a national, regional and local level. In some regions, it has been shown that investments in water supply and sanitation can yield a net economic benefit, since the reductions in adverse health effects and health care costs outweigh the costs of undertaking the interventions.

## Vertebrate Detection

Live link for the web - [Vertebrate Detector](https://share.streamlit.io/hrushi11/vertebrate-detection/main/app.py)

Vertebrate : An animal of a large group distinguished by the possession of a backbone or spinal column, including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fishes.

Visit the blog here - [Vertebrate Detection](https://hrushi11.github.io/Heights-for-AI/Vertebrate_Detection/)

Vertebrates available : 'Bear', 'Brown bear', 'Bull', 'Butterfly', 'Camel', 'Canary', 'Caterpillar', 'Cattle', 'Centipede', 'Cheetah', 'Chicken', 'Crab', 'Crocodile', 'Deer', 'Duck', 'Eagle', 'Elephant', 'Fish', 'Fox', 'Frog', 'Giraffe', 'Goat', 'Goldfish', 'Goose', 'Hamster', 'Harbor seal', 'Hedgehog', 'Hippopotamus', 'Horse', 'Jaguar', 'Jellyfish', 'Kangaroo', 'Koala', 'Ladybug', 'Leopard', 'Lion', 'Lizard', 'Lynx', 'Magpie', 'Monkey', 'Moths and butterflies', 'Mouse', 'Mule', 'Ostrich', 'Otter', 'Owl', 'Panda', 'Parrot', 'Penguin', 'Pig', 'Polar bear', 'Rabbit', 'Raccoon', 'Raven', 'Red panda', 'Rhinoceros', 'Scorpion', 'Sea lion', 'Sea turtle', 'Seahorse', 'Shark', 'Sheep', 'Shrimp', 'Snail', 'Snake', 'Sparrow', 'Spider', 'Squid', 'Squirrel', 'Starfish', 'Swan', 'Tick', 'Tiger', 'Tortoise', 'Turkey', 'Turtle', 'Whale', 'Woodpecker', 'Worm', 'Zebra'

The model got an accuracy of about 80% on test data.
